# Day 2 - React.js

## Introduction

Welcome to day 2 of the course functional programming in JavaScript with React and Redux. Today is all about getting familiar with React to create graphical user interfaces. We will combine react with some of the functional programming concepts we learned from day 1. Facebook open sourced React in 2013 and it has since then become one of the most popular libraries for creating the view of web applications.

The day will start with an introduction to React. In this part, we will be working on different assignments to get familiar with some of the core concepts of React. Will start with some basics and add more complexity on the way.

After we have been familiarized with React and created some components  we will start to work on a case assignment. The case is to create a Memory like game. Today we will work on the view logic and on the last day, we will work to connect everything together. Memory is the game where you have a number of card pairs facing down on a board.  On each card, there is a picture, and the job is to find all the matching pairs using the lowest amount of turns. A turn plays out by flipping two cards of the playerâ€™s choice, if the two cards flipped has the same image, these cards are removed from the board, if not the two cards are turned back on its back. The challenge is to memorize the location of flipped cards and remove all the pairs from the board as fast as possible.

Remember, we are here to help you learn. Do not hesitate to ask questions. We will walk around and help you with the assignments. If a part is difficult, please tell us, or just skip it.


## Part 1 - React warm up

Hello World example:
```javascript

const Hello = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      { props.name }
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Hello name='World'/>, document.getElementById('app'));
```
### Assignment:
* Create a component `<Actor />` that displays `"Leonardo DeCaprio"` and render it to the screen.
[Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/5/edit?html,js,output)

* Add the property `name` to the `<Actor/>` component and pass `Leonardo DeCaprio` as a property rather than setting the name as a hard coded value.
[Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/6/edit?js,output)

* Create a new component `<Actors/>` that displays 3 actors of your choice using the `<Actor/>` component for each actor.
[Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/12/edit?js,output)

* Use the list of actors bellow as a prop to the `<Actors/>` component. Render each actor in the list as a `<Actor/>` component. [Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/15/edit?js,output)
```javascript
const actorList = [
  'Leonardo DiCaprio',
  'Matt Damon',
  'Michael Fassbender',
  'Cate Blanchett',
];
```
Hint:
```javascript
const fruitList = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange'];
const fruits = fruitList.map((fruit) => {
    return ( <div>{ fruit }</div> );
});
```

* Extend the `<actors/>` and `<actor/>` components to show the name and number of Oscars for each actor. [Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/24/edit?js,output)
```javascript
const actorsWithOscars = [
    {
      name: 'Jack Nicholson',
      oscars: 3
    },
    {
      name: 'Katharine Hepburn',
      oscars: 4
    },
    {
      name: 'Kevin Spacey',
      oscars: 2
    },
    {
      name: 'Tom Hanks',
      oscars: 2
    },
    {
      name: 'Leonardo DeCaprio',
      oscars: 1
    },
    {
      name: 'Johnny Depp',
      oscars: 0
    },
];
```
* Sort the actors by number of Oscars. [Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/29/edit?js,output)

* Show only Actors with more than 2 Oscars. [Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/34/edit?js,output)

* Show the actor currently holding the highest number of Oscars. [Solution](http://jsbin.com/sojejoz/42/edit?js,console,output)

Extra:
* Show a list of how many actors that have a given number of Oscars. e.g `2 has 1 Oscar `
* Create a list Grouped by number of oscars
```
1 Oscar
    * Leonardo DeCaprio
2 Oscar
    * Kevin Spacey
    * Tom Hanks
```


## Part 2 - Memory game
In this part, we will start to setup the view logic of the Memory game. We have provided an object `data` that represent a snapshot of the game state. We will use this state to help us create and test the layout of the game.

```javascript
const data = {
  cards: [
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/1/", matched: false, open: true},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/1/", matched: false, open: false},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/2/", matched: false, open: false},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/2/", matched: false, open: false},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/3/", matched: false, open: false},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/3/", matched: false, open: false},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/4/", matched: false, open: true},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/4/", matched: false, open: true},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/5/", matched: true, open: true},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/5/", matched: true, open: true},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/6/", matched: true, open: true},
    { item: "http://lorempixel.com/200/200/cats/6/", matched: true, open: true},
  ],
  rounds: 10,
  highscore: 0,
};

const cardBacksideUrl = "http://lorempixel.com/image_output/abstract-q-g-200-200-10.jpg";
```
### 1. Create a Card
We will start to create a `<Card />` component. The `<card />` component will be used to represent one card on the board. A card has three possible states, `backside up`, `image side up` and `matched`.

* Create a `<Card />` component and pass `data.cards[0]` as a prop named `data`. The component should render a `<div>` with the className `"card"`.
```
<div className="card">Hello card</div>
```
* Make the `<Card />` component render an image from the URL passed in as `props.data.item`.

* When `props.data.open` is set to `false`, render an image from the URL `cardBacksideUrl` rather than the URL from `props.data.item`. Remember that you can test different states by changing the values in the `data` object.

* If `props.data.matched` is set to `true`, add the className `matched` to the card `<div>`

### 2. Create a Board
Now we will create the `<Board />` component holding the `<Cards />`

* Create and render a <Board /> component and pass `data.cards` as a prop named `cards`. The component should render a `<div>` with className `"board"`

* Render a `<Card />` for all the card data in `props.cards`

### 3. Create a Game component
// todo

### 4. MoveCounter
// todo

### 5. Highscore
// todo
